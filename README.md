# Cat-Owner-Questionnaire :cat:

_Cat owner questionnaire was created on 2nd week of studying at [ITGirlSchool] (study subject: "HTML5 form tags") and upgraded on week 18 ("Form validation"), week 19 ("OOP") and week 21 ("GET and POST requests")_

Initially the form had following inputs:

1. Pet name, owner names and address (_text fields_);
2. Pet race (_select_);
3. Type of food (_checkbox_);
4. Male/female (_radio buttons_);
5. Comments of the owner (_text area_);
6. Add pet's photo (_possibility to load a photo from disk drive_);
7. "Save" button.

18th week upgrade:
1. HTML5 form-validation;
2. Responsive layout;
3. Automatic formatting of inputs with proper names, phone and e-mail;
4. Photo preview.

19th week upgrade:
1. `Cat` class with properties that correspond the questionnaire fields; 
2. Creating the objects of this class on "Send" button click and showing result in console and storing result in Local storage.

21st week upgrade:
1. POST-request, on "Send" button click realised with FormData;
2. JS form validation before form-sending.
