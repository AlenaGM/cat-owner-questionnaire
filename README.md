# Cat Owner Questionnaire :cat:

_JavaScript Form_

This JavaScript Form was created during the 2nd week of studying at [ITGirlSchool], focusing on the study subject of "HTML5 form tags". It has since been upgraded during weeks 18 ("Form validation"), 19 ("OOP"), and 21 ("GET and POST requests").

Initially, I built a basic form with _input fields, select, checkbox, radio buttons, and more_ to practice using HTML5 form tags.

In week 18, I improved the form by adding _HTML5 form validation_ and _autoformatting for text, phone, and email inputs_. I also made the layout responsive and added the ability to load and preview pet photos.

During week 19, I upgraded the form by creating a _`Cat` class_ with properties that correspond to the questionnaire data. I also created an _instance of this class_ and _stored it in Local Storage_.

In week 21, I implemented a _POST-request_ using _FormData_ for form submission.
