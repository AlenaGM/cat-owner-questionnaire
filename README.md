# Cat-Owner-Questionnaire :cat:
_JS Form created on 2nd week of studying at [ITGirlSchool] (study subject: "HTML5 form tags") and upgraded on week 18 ("Form validation"), week 19 ("OOP") and week 21 ("GET and POST requests")_

A basic form with _text fields, select, checkbox, radio buttons, etc._ was built to train HTML5 form tags at the very beginning of code learning. 

It was improved by adding _HTML5 form-validation_ and _autoformatting of inputs with text, phone and e-mail_ on week 18. I also made layout responsive and added possibility to load and preview pet photo.

Week 19 upgrade consisted in creating a _`Cat` class_ with properties that correspond the questionnaire data, as well as creating the _objects of this class_ and _storing result in Local storage._

21st week upgrade were: POST-request realised with FormData and JS form validation prior to form-sending.
